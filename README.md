<h1>Secure Home Network Deployment - Linux</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project involves setting up and configuring a robust home network, moving from a standard consumer-grade router to a custom-built, server-centric system.


what is being done and implemented:
  - A dedicated Rhel derivative Linux server is being set up to act as the central router and firewall for the entire home network.
  - This server will handle all IP address assignments (DHCP) and implement network-wide ad-blocking and content filtering using AdGuard Home (DNS).
  - A Virtual Private Network (VPN) server (WireGuard) is being configured on the Linux server for secure remote access.
  - The network will be logically divided into separate security zones (e.g., a main trusted network and an isolated network for guests and smart home devices) to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access between different types of devices.
  - Network speed is being upgraded with 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet for faster internet and internal data transfers.
  - All network components, configurations, and security measures are being thoroughly documented.

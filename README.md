  - A Virtual Private Network (VPN) server (WireGuard) is being configured on the Linux server for secure remote access.
  - The network will be logically divided into separate security zones (e.g., a main trusted network and an isolated network for guests and smart home devices) to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access between different types of devices.
  - Network speed is being upgraded with 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet for faster internet and internal data transfers.

# Secure Home Network Deployment - Linux

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up and configuring a robust home network, moving from a standard consumer-grade router to a custom-built, server-centric system.

**Key implementations include:**

-   A dedicated RHEL derivative Linux server is being set up to act as the central router and firewall for the entire home network.
-   This server will handle all IP address assignments (DHCP) and implement network-wide ad-blocking and content filtering using AdGuard Home (DNS).
-   A Virtual Private Network (VPN) server (WireGuard) is being configured on the Linux server for secure remote access.
-   The network will be logically divided into separate security zones (e.g., a main trusted network and an isolated network for guests and smart home devices) to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access between different types of devices.
-   Network speed is being upgraded with 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet for faster internet and internal data transfers.
-   All network components, configurations, and security measures are being thoroughly documented.
